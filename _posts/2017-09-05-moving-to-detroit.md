title: I am moving to Detroit!

Sally is from Detroit and every time we go there to visit friends or family, I'm always impressed with something new I learn about the city. I moved to Chicago in 2007 from California, and while I always knew the Windy City would be temporary, I would have never guessed 10 years ago that my next stop would be Detroit. Now that Sally and I are beginning to make some contacts for video work and have a community of people there to welcome us, starting a new chapter in our lives feels like the right thing to do.

I am trying to approach my move there with consideration for the existing infrastructure of people and their communities, as I know a white guy from California hasn't much right to be using Detroit as a playground. I am ready to be a resident of Detroit in a way that supports the city on its terms, not just my own, and I am open to listen and learn.

So excited for our move there, I will be a resident of Detroit, MI as of November 1st, 2017.
