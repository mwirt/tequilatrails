I will be playing in a couple bands for what will be my final show as a resident of Chicago. **The Great Lakesmen** and **Spruce Bringsteen** (or **Miss Bossy and the D Street Band**) will both be playing at <a href="http://cafemustache.com">Cafe Mustache</a>  on Halloween (Oct. 31st). It will be the perfect way to say goodbye to Chicago, playing in bands with some of my best friends here. I will miss everyone very much.
