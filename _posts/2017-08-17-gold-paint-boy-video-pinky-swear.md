I had a blast playing Gold Paint Boy songs with the old band a couple weeks ago. Thanks to <a href="https://temporarycorrespondence.wordpress.com/">Temporary Correspondence</a> for recording this clip of our set! It was a special night(despite all of our rustiness) as it was the first time in a few years playing as Gold Paint Boy with that particular group(the original band).
