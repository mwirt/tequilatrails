Over a year in the making, the mystery miniseries Sally and I have been making as a passion project with two of our most favorite friends (who happen to both be named Katie) will finally get its premiere on October 5th, 2017 at <a href="http://nightingalecinema.org/">The Nightingale Cinema</a>. We are thrilled to finally be finished with it, are happy with the outcome and are overwhelmed with the community's support seeing the project to fruition. We hope to pack the house, so come out Oct. 5th!
